# bandersnatch

> Super lightweight and friendly CLI framework for Node.js.

**ðŸš§ but not quite yet**

## Features

- Built-in REPL
- Prompts for missing arguments
- Autocompletes arguments, options and values
- Fully typed
- Possible to use all `yargs` & `inquirer` features

It's built in TypeScript and while it's of course possible to write your app
with JavaScript, you're missing out on some very handy type assurance.

We don't have a generator, auto-updater and we don't make any decisions for you
(apart from using inquirer for prompts). This makes bandersnatch pretty easy and
intuitive to work with.
